# Personal Dashboard

A clean and minimal personal productivity dashboard built with **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project was created as my first complete front-end build to practice DOM manipulation, API integration, and Tailwind CSS styling.

## Features

- **Live Digital Clock** – Real-time clock that updates every second.
- **Weather Widget** – Fetches your current location and displays live weather data using the OpenWeather API.
- **To-Do Manager** – Add, complete, and delete up to 5 tasks with real-time pending/completed status tracking.
- **Local Storage Support** – Saves your name for a personalized greeting across sessions.

## Status

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is currently a **work-in-progress** and **not fully responsive yet**.  
> A fully optimized and responsive version is planned to be rebuilt using **React**.
